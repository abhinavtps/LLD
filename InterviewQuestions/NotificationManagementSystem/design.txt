1.1 Functional Requirements

• The system should support sending notifications via EMAIL, SMS, and PUSH.
• Each notification targets a single recipient and a specific channel.
• The system should send notifications asynchronously.
• If sending fails, the system should retry the operation a few times before giving up.
• Notifications may contain a subject (optional) and a message body (mandatory).

1.2 Non-Functional Requirements

• The system should follow object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns.
• It should be extensible, allowing future support for new notification types (e.g., WhatsApp, Slack).
• Delivery should be non-blocking, using a thread pool to manage parallel sending.



Core Entities:

Enums:

1. NotificationType -- it will be SMS, EMAIL, PUSH



1. Recipient(Actual user which will recieve the message through the channels)
2. Notification(Actual notification which needs to be sent to the recipient)
2.5 NotificationBuilder
3. NotificationChannel -- interface
4. EmailNotificationChannel -- concrete implementation of NotificationChannel
5. SmsNotificationChannel -- concrete implementation of NotificationChannel
6. PushNotificationChannel -- concrete implementation of NotificationChannel
7. RetryNotificationDecorator -- concrete decorator implementation of NotificationChannel
7.5 NotificationChannelFactory -- class to generate different types of channels -- other way could be Factory-method pattern, but we can keep things simple here

8. NotificationService -- the main service responsible for send the notification
9. NotificationServiceDemo

Key design pattern which can be used here:
1. Decorator pattern -- for sending notification with retries
2. Builder pattern -- Can be used for Notification object creation
3. Factory pattern -- used to generate different type of NotificationChannels object
4. Strategy Pattern -- used as different notification channel (combination of NotificationChannel + EmailNotificationChannel + SmsNotificationChannel + PushNotificationChannel)
